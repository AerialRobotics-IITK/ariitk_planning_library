# debug flags
verbose: false                      # Print additional debug and timing information.
visualize: true                     # Whether to publish information for visualization in RViz.

# frames
world_frame: world                  # The base frame used when looking up tf transforms.
                                    # This is also the frame that most outputs are given in.
frame_id: world                     # Global fixed frame id.
local_frame_id: world               # Frame name for the quadrotor base.

                                    # Recommended value: equal to robot_radius
